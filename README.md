#### 🧭 Simple Routing
Implementing routes in Unity has never been easier! With a simple attribute that you write over the function you can specify both the HTTP method and the path.


#### ⭐ Event Based
All route handlers are registered via an event-based system on the server. You only need to drag and drop the route handler into the server.


#### 📦 Resource Loading
Using Resource Loading you can load files from the Resources folder of your game and output them via the HTTP server. See the example "2. Load Files from Resource Folder" in the Examples folder.


#### ⚡ Fast
The speed of the server is overwhelming, which is achieved by using only native implementations. To ensure this, external libraries were deliberately avoided during development.


#### 📚 Multiple Instances
The event based architecture makes it possible to run many different servers over different ports at the same time.


#### 🏠 Listening Addresses
Under Listening Addresses you can not only select the ports to listen on, but also specify whether the server is accessible from the home network or only from the same computer.
